# Active Window Plugin (WIP)

This repository contains the project code for the Active Window plugin for [Grid Editor](https://github.com/intechstudio/grid-editor).

The plugin allows the Editor to automatically change the active bank page based on the currently focused window. 
The plugin can be configured in the preferences window. 
The trigger application field should match the Active Window value for the page change to work.
